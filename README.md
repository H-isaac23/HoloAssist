# HoloAssist
This is a desktop script for assisting with HoloTools for watching hololive content over a local area network. This is an extension to the project "Youtube Streams Liker".

## Project Status
This project is currently halfway done, with logging into google and playing all of the streams as the latest accomplishment. This will be second in priority as to what I will complete first in my projects, so there will be frequent updates on this repo.

## Third Party Libraries and Dependencies

* [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/)
* [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/)
* [mysql-connector-python](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/)
